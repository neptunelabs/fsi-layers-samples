# Product detail page - FSI Layers JS builded

In this example, FSI Layers is not defined as HTML tag,
but exclusively generated by JavaScript.

The ``index.html`` is only a template that is filled by ``pds.js``

After the PDP class is loaded and initialized, the file ``bread-data.json`` will be loaded.
We simulate the loading of only data needed to be used from a backend via REST.

If this is successful, the function ``buildFSILayers`` is called and a FSI layer is created with
``$FSI.Layers.init``.
On creation, the event listener ``onReady`` is told to call ``initProduct``
after creation.

That's basically the gist of the demo, since after the completion of the steps above the data loaded via REST is simply converted
into buttons.
These buttons then have corresponding event listeners to show and hide
the layers:

```javascript
showLayer(groupName, name) {
// hide/show fsi-layer within a group
this.layerEl.setProperties(this.getLayerName(groupName, name), { hidden: false })
if (this.getSelection(groupName) !== name) {
this.layerEl.setProperties(this.getLayerName(groupName, this.getSelection(groupName)), { hidden: true })
}
this.layerEl.render()
```
